undeaD
======

Need an obsolete Phobos module? Here they are, back from the dead and upgraded to work with the latest D

Current modules included:

* std.bitarray
* std.date
* std.datebase
* std.dateparse
* std.regexp
* std.stream and friends
* std.xml

Some individual functions have been moved here rather than full Phobos modules. They are

* undead.doformat: Contains the `doFormat` function from std.format
* undead.string: Contains regex style pattern matching functions from std.string
